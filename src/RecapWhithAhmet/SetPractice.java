    Posible interview questions:

    1-How do yoy make the element unique with collection (American style)
    1-What is set? what is the purpose of using it?(Indian Style)

    -->Im my projecr,i was using to make element "UNIQUE" to prevent dublication which causes some technical and businnes issue.
    -->It is away to store unique elements only

    2-Can you tell me the types of collections?

    -->As much as i know since it has been long time ,I didn't use the one of them:
    --> We have List                                                       **>Set
              Arrays List and LinkedList                              -->HashSet-->Randomly store the elements(unique)
                                                                       -->LinkedHashSet-->Insertion order(unique)
                                                                      -->TreeSet-->Ascending order




    3-Can you Explain the difference between Set and List?

    -->List                                                        -->Set
-->Only Unique Elements (no dublicates)                             -->It can store Dublicate elements
-->It has different sub-types (HashSet,LinkedSet,TreeSet)            -->ArrayList,LinkedList
**->There is no indexing in Set*******                                -->It work mostly indexing
